    <h2>Augusta National</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Augusta National Golf Club, located in Augusta, Georgia, is one of the most famous golf clubs in the world. Founded
        by Bobby Jones and Clifford Roberts on the site of the former Fruitland (later Fruitlands) Nursery, the course was
        designed by Jones and Alister MacKenzie and opened for play in January 1933. Since 1934, it has played host to the
        annual Masters Tournament, one of the four major championships in professional golf, and the only major played each
        year at the same course. It was the top-ranked course in Golf Digest's 2009 list of America's 100 greatest courses
        and was the number ten ranked course on Golfweek Magazine's 2011 list of best classic courses in the United States,
        in terms of course architecture.</p>

      <h4>Amen Corner</h4>
      <p>The second shot at the 11th, all of the 12th, and the first two shots at the 13th hole at Augusta are nicknamed "Amen
        Corner". This term was first used in print by author Herbert Warren Wind in his April 21, 1958, Sports Illustrated
        article about the Masters that year. In a Golf Digest article in April 1984, 26 years later, Wind told about its
        origin. He said he wanted a catchy phrase like baseball's "hot-corner" or football's "coffin-corner" to explain where
        some of the most exciting golf had taken place (the Palmer-Venturi rules issue at twelve, over an embedded ball ruling
        and how it was handled, in particular). Thus "Amen Corner" was born.</p>

      <h4>The Green Jacket</h4>
      <p>Every member of Augusta National receives a green sport coat with the club's logo on the left breast. The idea of the
        green jacket originated with club co-founder Clifford Roberts. Many believe it is because he wanted patrons visiting
        during the tournament to be able to readily identify members. Since Sam Snead's victory in 1949, the winner of each
        year's Masters Tournament has received a green jacket, although he does not receive membership. The jacket is presented
        to the new winner by the winner of the previous tournament. If the previous champion is either unavailable or has
        won consecutive tournaments, then the current chairman acts as the presenter.</p>
